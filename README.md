Overview
--------
It's a lightweight example of iOS feature toggling system inspired by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html). If you have any questions you can ask me in [telegram](https://t.me/iltsarev).

You can also watch the video of my speech on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/H9Ff6R_4Mw8?t=4h45m00s) (in Russian).

Usage
--------

Initialize feature service somewhere in your code:
``` swift
private let featureService = FeaturesService()
```

Get features from backend:
``` swift
featureService.getFeatures {}
```

Check if feature is enabled:
``` swift
if featureService.enabled(.myFeature) {
  // doSomething
}
```
